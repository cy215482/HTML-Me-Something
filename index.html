        <h2>Robotics</h2>
        <p>
            When I started High school I was looking for a extra curricular activity to do. That was when I joined the local robotics club.
            I did robotics three our of my four years of attending high school.
            During my time at this club I recieved two medals along with the rest of my team during competitions.
            We placed 2nd both of those times and ended up placing 47th out of 400 teams nationwide.
            Each year there is a new competition which essentially means your team has to build a new robot from scratch and has to meet certain requirements.
            Some of the requirements were: weight, length, height, width and extension limitation to the robot.
            One year we had to build a robot to be able to shoot a regular size frisbee into a basketball net and climb a 8ft tall metal pyramid.
            Another year we built one to shoot balls into a goal above your head while also being able to cross a teeter totter and at the end be able to balance on it with another robot.

        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>
            My other main hobby that I love to do in any free time that I have is to game. I'm not a professional, but I would consider myself close on certain games.
            This is becuase I normally game anywhere from 10-40 hours a week. I know what you're thinking, "really", but I do assure you that bills are paid and the house is cleaned.
            I play mostly first person shooter games such as all the Call of Duty's, but I also like Mortal Combat and Grand Theft Auto.
            My favorite part about the game isn't the campaign itself but the extra stuff like Zombies, Extinction or Squads.
            The other plus about gaming is meeting new people from all over the world.
            I know people right now from Australia, UK, Mexico, Canada, Jamaica, Texas and Ohio.

        <!-- hey macklemore let's go --> <h2>Thift Shopping</h2>
        <p>
            My third and final hobby I would say is the most time consuming. I love to go to thrift stores to find good deals.
            Some of the best deals you can get are on shoes and clothing.
            If you're lucky sometimes you can find decent furniture to fix up or household applicances that have never been used.
            My best finds are usually on shoes becuase I've found $80-$120 Converse for $20-40 brand new.
            Also lots of name brand clothing that usually runs $40-$80 for usually around $5-$15.
            I usually go to Goodwill, The Pound Store (Goodwill but bigger) garage sales and Burlington.
